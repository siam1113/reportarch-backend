# config Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains configuration files for the backend project. Its main role is to centralize and manage settings such as database connections, environment variables, and other setup logic.

## Definition
Configuration refers to the process of setting up the environment and dependencies required for an application to run. In software projects, a config directory helps keep these settings organized and separate from business logic.

## Example & Analogy
- **Analogy:** Think of config as the control panel of a car, where you set the temperature, radio station, and seat position before driving. Similarly, config files set up the environment before the app starts.
- **Example:** The `db.js` file in this directory connects the app to MongoDB using credentials from `.env`.

## For Newcomers
Whenever you need to change how the app connects to external services (like databases), look in the config directory first.
