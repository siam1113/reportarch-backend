# controllers Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains controller files, which handle the main logic for each API endpoint. Controllers process requests, interact with models, and send responses.

## Definition
A controller is a function or module that receives input from routes, performs operations (like reading/writing data), and returns results to the client.

## Example & Analogy
- **Analogy:** Think of controllers as chefs in a restaurant. The waiter (route) brings an order, the chef (controller) prepares the meal (logic), and the waiter delivers it back.
- **Example:** The `orgController.js` file contains functions to create, update, delete, and get organizations.

## For Newcomers
If you want to change how data is processed or add business logic, update the controllers.
