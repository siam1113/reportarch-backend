# routes Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains route files that define the API endpoints and map them to controller functions. Routes handle incoming HTTP requests and direct them to the appropriate logic.

## Definition
A route is a path in the application that responds to HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and triggers specific controller actions.

## Example & Analogy
- **Analogy:** Think of routes as the menu in a restaurant. Each menu item (route) tells the waiter (server) what the customer wants, and the waiter passes the order to the chef (controller).
- **Example:** The `org.js` route file defines endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and getting organizations.

## For Newcomers
To add or change API endpoints, update the route files in this directory.
